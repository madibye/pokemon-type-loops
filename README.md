# Pokemon Type Loops
a stupid thing generated by a script i put into [my discord bot](https://github.com/madibye/Madi-the-Koala/blob/master/handlers/type_matchups.py) last night at 4am. inspired by [ShepskyDad's type triangles video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_HZYzs-tUA).

the text files are named by the amount of "sides" the loop has and the max number of types allowed in a combination.

currently just have files for 3 or 4 sides and 1 or 2 types. do note that the dual-type square loops are uhhh... well, there's about 3.7 million of them, the file is 210mb and couldn't upload to discord OR github (had to split it into 3 parts as you can see), aaaaaaand the file took about 12 hours to generate (compared to 10 minutes for the dual-type triangles). sooo, type pentagons might be a bit tough for me at the moment.

also a "perfect loop" is defined if each type's resistance and weakness to the types around it are all the same. e.g. fire -> water -> grass is a perfect loop, since they all do 2x to the next type and have a 0.5x resistance to the next type.
