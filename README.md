# Pokemon Type Loops
a stupid thing generated by a script i put into [my discord bot](https://github.com/madibye/Madi-the-Koala/blob/master/handlers/type_matchups.py) last night at 4am. inspired by [ShepskyDad's type triangles video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_HZYzs-tUA).

the text files are named by the amount of "sides" the loop has and the max number of types allowed in a combination.

currently just have files for 3 sides and 1 or 2 types. the amount of time difference it takes between 1 and 2 is uhhh... well, let's just say 1 second vs. several hours. i might do more later but we'll see.

also a "perfect loop" is defined if each type's resistance and weakness to the types around it are all the same. e.g. fire -> water -> grass is a perfect loop, since they all do 2x to the next type and resist the next type by 0.5x
